**This repo is still in the early stages of development, there will be breaking API changes**

Arraylias is an open-source Python library for writing Python code that
can be run on multiple array types by aliasing different array libraries.
Arraylias enables users to reduce the time and effort of writing codes to use various arrays.
Arraylias provides supports for aliasing some array libraries, [NumPy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy),
[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), and [Tensorflow](https://github.com/tensorflow).

Also, Arraylias provides another features about [Scipy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy). 
Scipy is an open-source Python library for scientific computing. It builds on Numpy and provides support for mathematical operations, matrix calculation, and multi-dimensional arrays. Some array types allows to use scipy-like modules, which are built on the respective array libraries. Arraylias provides aliases for these scipy-like modules.
